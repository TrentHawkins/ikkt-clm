IKKT Matrix model: Complex Langevin method (object-oriented-implementation)

compile in ./

sequential:

   ifort -module "ifort/objects" -fast -nowarn -o ifort/bin/a.out
         [-DBLAS] [-DOPTIMAL] main/main.F90 -mkl=sequential -lmkl_blas95_lp64 -lmkl_lapack95_lp64 -lmkl_core -lpthread -lm -ldl

parallel:

   ifort -module "ifort/objects" -fast -parallel -nowarn -o ifort/bin/a.out
         [-DBLAS] [-DOPTIMAL] main/main.F90 -mkl=parallel -lmkl_blas95_lp64 -lmkl_lapack95_lp64 -lmkl_core -lpthread -lm -ldl

Inside [...] are optional preprocesor flags:
BLAS: use BLAS for internal linear algebra operations instead of Fortran's intrinsics
OPTIMAL: use custom-tailored linear operations optimisation suitable for specific-form fermion matrices


You may need the option "-mcmodel=medium" if the stored arrays are too large, which conflicts with the "-fast" option.
This is unnecessary in the optimized version using commutators, as the fermion matrix is bypassed.

The compiled program takes 1 argument has 7 options:

-c: use old configuration, filename is internal for now, so no argument (TODO)
-a: use cold (0) or hot (1) initial field configuration. using this option is mandatory
-t: use dynamic time-step based on drift norm behaviour
-f: use fermions in the simulation (not using is jsut a normalization test case for the simulation's noise)
-g: apply gauge cooling in each step. In the end we want to use this
-m: include mass deformations of the system that allow simulating it away from singular drifts

The argument is a file base name for use in the various output files.

The program for now queries the total time, average time-step, and average skip-time for measurements. The rest of the constant
parameters can be found in "./ikkt/fields.F90". They will be moved from there later, compile time constants will go to a new file,
and the more customizable parameters will also be querried run-time instead too. (TODO)

Jack-knife is a separate program under "./jack_knife/". You compile seperately with:

   ifort -module "ifort/modules" -fast -w jack_knife/main.F90

Jack-knife has four versions, accounting on whether you wish to measure susceptibility as well, and whether the data are timed with
a dynamic time-step instead of a static one.

-j: how many jack-knife bins to take; it defines the jack-knife bin width later on
-w: use weighted averages because you know the data are timed with a dynamic time-step
-x: measure susceptibility along with plain observables

The argument is the time history file name to process.
